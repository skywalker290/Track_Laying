# Track_Laying
  WE TRIED CREATING A PROGRAM EFFICENT ENOUGH TO LAY A TRACK ON AN GIVEN SET OF MAP WITH SOME WATER BODIES AND MOUNTAINS AND MANY MORE OBSTACLES.
  
  WE TRIED TWO APPROACHES:
  
  1->CONNECT LONGEST TRACK AND THEN ATTACH THE OTHER CITIES WITH THE NEARBY TRACK.
  
  2->FIND A POINT IN ALL THE MATRIX WHICH CAN SERVE AS A JUNCTION FOR ALL THE CITIES AND THEN CONNECT THE PATH FROM JUNCTION TO ALL CITIES.
